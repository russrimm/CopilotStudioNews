### Key Adoption Themes (30 Days)
1. Multimodal + Execution: Code interpreter & image/file pipeline unlock compound automation (consider cost & governance).  
2. Knowledge Scale & Structure: File groups + high file count preview necessitate taxonomy strategy to avoid dilution.  
3. Quality Feedback Loop: New analytics (answer gaps) enables measurable iteration cadence.  
4. Secure Extensibility: MCP guided connection + credential blocking preview tighten external integration posture.  
5. Channel Expansion: WhatsApp preview drives need for concise, locale-ready conversational design.  

### Immediate Actions Checklist
- [ ] Stand up weekly “Answer Quality” review using new analytics dashboard.
- [ ] Draft file grouping & naming convention before bulk 1000-file ingestion preview scales.
- [ ] Audit maker-owned credentials; prepare migration runbook for preview credential blocking control.
- [ ] Pilot code interpreter in a sandbox; log execution metrics & outliers.
- [ ] Tag all MCP-added tools with owner + data sensitivity metadata.
- [ ] Run localization QA on WhatsApp message variants (fallback & error prompts). 

## Notes & Disclaimers
- Planned GA dates may shift per official Microsoft communications; always verify in current release plans.
- Preview features should not be relied upon for production SLAs until GA unless explicitly approved.
- Some features (e.g., catalog discovery, file groups) transitioned from preview to GA during the window—table reflects initial release month plus current status.
