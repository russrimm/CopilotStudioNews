### Key Adoption Themes (30 Days)
<details open>
<summary>Expand / collapse themes</summary>

1. Multimodal & Execution ‚Äì Code interpreter + image/file pipeline enable compound transformations (govern cost & data scope).  
2. Knowledge Scale & Structure ‚Äì File groups + high file count preview require taxonomy & pruning discipline.  
3. Quality Feedback Loop ‚Äì New answer quality analytics institutionalize weekly remediation cycles.  
4. Secure Extensibility ‚Äì MCP guided connection + credential blocking preview harden integration posture.  
5. Channel Expansion ‚Äì WhatsApp preview drives concise, locale-aware conversational design patterns.  

</details>

### Immediate Actions Checklist
- [ ] Stand up weekly "Answer Quality" review using analytics dashboard.
- [ ] Finalize file grouping & naming convention before scaling ingestion (1000-file preview).
- [ ] Audit maker-owned credentials; draft migration runbook for credential blocking control.
- [ ] Pilot code interpreter in sandbox; capture execution metrics & outliers.
- [ ] Tag MCP-added tools with owner + data sensitivity metadata.
- [ ] Run localization QA on WhatsApp variants (fallback & error prompts).
- [ ] Establish sensitivity label mapping validation workflow (MIP preview).

<summary>Key Guidance</summary>

1. Treat TBD / Planned GA as provisional; re‚Äëverify before dependency commitments.  
2. Governance first: credentials, catalog metadata, sensitivity labeling.  
3. Quality instrumentation precedes scale‚Äîbaseline before rollout.  
4. Advanced models (deep reasoning, BYO, tuning) need curated high-quality datasets & evaluation matrices.  
5. Avoid knowledge bloat‚Äîprune low-signal files before exploiting 1000-file scale.
