# Welcome to Copilot News
Created by: Russ Rimmerman, Microsoft Cloud Solution Architect (<mailto:russ.rimmerman@microsoft.com>)

## Overview
This repository curates timely, authoritative updates about Microsoft Copilot Studio: new features, previews, GA milestones, roadmap signals, and governance/security advancements. It centralizes what shipped (6‑month & 12‑month lenses) and offers a collaboration space to discuss impact, adoption patterns, and implementation best practices.

## Goals
- Provide a single, link-rich digest of Copilot Studio evolution.
- Track GA vs Preview status with source-backed dates.
- Accelerate solution design with categorized feature summaries.
- Enable community knowledge sharing (patterns, gotchas, metrics).

## Key Artifacts
| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `README.md` | Rolling 30‑day retrospective & forward (next 30 days) tables. |
| `archive/Last_6_Months_Features.md` | Hyperlinked recent 6‑month catalog (historical reference). |
| `archive/Last_12_Months_Features.md` | Extended 12‑month catalog (Sept 2024–Aug 2025) including previews. |

## Discussion Categories (Recommended Structure)
| Category | Use Case Examples |
|----------|-------------------|
| Announcements | Maintainer posts: refresh cycles, methodology changes. |
| Feature Deep Dives | Community analyses of a specific GA/Preview feature. |
| Adoption & ROI | Metrics, KPIs, success stories, cost optimization. |
| Security & Governance | DLP, CMK, audit logs, labeling, policy patterns. |
| Extensibility & MCP | Model Context Protocol scenarios, external toolchains, custom models. |
| Roadmap Watch | Interpreting release plans / impact planning. |
| Q&A / Help | Clarifications, “how do I implement X?” |

## Update Cadence
| Artifact | Frequency | Trigger |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Rolling 30-Day Tables | Daily (automated) | Scheduled workflows (date + AI refresh). |
| 6‑Month Archive | On demand (manual) | When significant batch of new features GA/preview. |
| 12‑Month Archive | Monthly (manual) | Month rollover & aging out >12 months. |
| Discussion Announcements | As needed | Major GA, breaking change, or taxonomy shift. |

## Tagging Convention
Use labels (or discussion tags) to streamline search:
- `ga`, `preview`, `security`, `governance`, `nlu`, `knowledge`, `channels`, `extensibility`, `analytics`, `autonomy`, `multimodal`, `auth`, `model`.
Combine (e.g., `preview:knowledge`, `ga:security`).

## Contribution Workflow
1. Open a Discussion (or Issue) with proposed addition/correction.
2. Provide: title, feature name, link to official Microsoft Learn / blog, status (GA/Preview), and justification (why it matters for builders or governance).
3. Maintainer validates source & categorization.
4. Merged into tables during next scheduled update (or immediately if critical).

## Source of Truth & Validation
Priority order for authoritative links:
1. Microsoft Learn product documentation.
2. Official Power Platform Release Plans (Wave docs).
3. Microsoft Copilot / Power Platform engineering blog posts.
4. TechCommunity posts from official product teams.
(Community blogs may inform commentary—but not status/GA dates.)

## Quality Bar for Entries
- Include a single canonical link (avoid duplicates).
- Status must reflect publicly documented state (avoid speculation).
- Purpose line ≤ 12 words, action-oriented.
- No confidential or NDA content.

## Roadmap Signals (How to Interpret “Planned”)
“Planned GA” months are windows, not guaranteed dates. Any shift: retain original month (strikethrough) + add updated month in notes (handled by maintainer).

## Metrics Ideas (Community Contributions Welcome)
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Adoption Velocity | Days from preview to GA across features. |
| Security Feature Uptake | % orgs enabling CMK, DLP, labeling. |
| Extensibility Penetration | # agents integrating MCP / custom models. |
| Knowledge Source Diversity | Avg unique knowledge source types per agent. |
| ROI Realization Lag | Time from feature GA to first ROI report post. |

## Governance & Compliance Focus
Features like CMK, Purview audit logs, sensitivity label surfacing, FIC auth, and XPIA mitigation are tracked explicitly to help enterprises accelerate secure rollout assessments.

## How to Get Involved Today
- Start a Discussion introducing your use case & top 3 feature priorities.
- Share a mini write-up of early findings using a new preview feature.
- Suggest a metric or dashboard idea to make the analytics section more actionable.
- Flag outdated dates or status labels.

## Future Enhancements (Planned)
| Idea | Status |
|------|--------|
| Automated diff bot for “What’s New” ingestion | Exploring |
| Weekly RSS/Markdown changelog export | Planned |
| Badge for first-time contributors | Idea |
| Visualization (timeline / swimlane) | Idea |
