DEPRECATED SCRIPT (No-Op)
This script previously refreshed a 6â€‘month feature table which has been retired.
It is intentionally left as a stub for historical reference and safety so that any
residual workflow invocation will not mutate repository content.

New automation:
  scripts/ai-refresh-rolling-windows.ps1

To remove entirely, delete this file after confirming no references remain.

Write-Host 'refresh-6month-table.ps1 is deprecated and performs no action.'
