## Curation Notes
- Items remain here until a named GA month enters the ≤60 day window, then shift to near-term tracking.
- "Stale?" column marks future potential for inactivity tagging; currently placeholder.
- Revalidate TBD items monthly against official Microsoft release channels.

## Next Review Checklist
- [ ] Confirm no GA month assigned to TBD items
- [ ] Re-scan Release Plan updates for new horizon entries
- [ ] Evaluate need to split model vs orchestration roadmap if list grows
